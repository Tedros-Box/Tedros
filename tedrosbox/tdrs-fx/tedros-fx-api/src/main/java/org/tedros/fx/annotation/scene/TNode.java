	*  Property description: 
	*  
	*  Additional hint for controlling bitmap caching. Under certain circumstances, such as animating 
	*  nodes that are very expensive to render, it is desirable to be able to perform transformations 
	*  on the node without having to regenerate the cached bitmap. An option in such cases is to perform 
	*  the transforms on the cached bitmap itself. This technique can provide a dramatic improvement 
	*  to animation performance, though may also result in a reduction in visual quality. 
	*  
	*  The cacheHint variable provides a hint to the system about how and when that trade-off 
	*  (visual quality for animation performance) is acceptable. It is possible to enable the cacheHint 
	*  only at times when your node is animating. In this way, expensive nodes can appear on screen with 
	*  full visual quality, yet still animate smoothly. 
	*  
	*  Example: 
	*       expensiveNode.setCache(true);
	*       expensiveNode.setCacheHint(CacheHint.QUALITY);
	*       ...
	*       // Do an animation

	*  Additional hint for controlling bitmap caching. 
	*  Under certain circumstances, such as animating nodes that are very expensive to render, it is 
	*  desirable to be able to perform transformations on the node without having to regenerate the cached bitmap. 
	*  An option in such cases is to perform the transforms on the cached bitmap itself. 
	*  This technique can provide a dramatic improvement to animation performance, though may also result in a 
	*  reduction in visual quality. The cacheHint variable provides a hint to the system about how and when that 
	*  trade-off (visual quality for animation performance) is acceptable. 
	*  It is possible to enable the cacheHint only at times when your node is animating. In this way, expensive nodes 
	*  can appear on screen with full visual quality, yet still animate smoothly. 
	*  
	*  Example: 
	*        expensiveNode.setCache(true);
	*        expensiveNode.setCacheHint(CacheHint.QUALITY);
	*        ...
	*       // Do an animation

	*        new Timeline(

	*                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.scaleYProperty(), 2.0),
	*                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.rotateProperty(), 360),
